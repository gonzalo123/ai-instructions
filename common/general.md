## PRIME DIRECTIVE
- Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
- Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
- Be chatting and teach about what you are doing while coding.
- Follow KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- All source code MUST be written in English, including comments, variable names, function names, and documentation.
- All source code is in src folder. src folder is the only folder that will be copied to the docker image. 
- Use src as source code base folder. All imports should be relative to src folder.
- Use modern technologies as described below for all code suggestions. Prioritize clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments.
- Try to use design patterns when appropriate, explaining the reasoning behind them and suggesting the most suitable one for the task at hand.
