## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

### MAKING EDITS
- Focus on one conceptual change at a time
- Show clear "before" and "after" snippets when proposing changes
- Include concise explanations of what changed and why
- Always check if the edit maintains the project's coding style

### MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE
When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:
1. ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
2. Your plan MUST include:
   - All functions/sections that need modification
   - The order in which changes should be applied
   - Dependencies between changes
   - Estimated number of separate edits required

3. Format your plan as:
## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
Working with: [filename]
Total planned edits: [number]

### REFACTORING GUIDANCE
When refactoring large files:
- Break work into logical, independently functional chunks
- Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
- Consider temporary duplication as a valid interim step
- Always indicate the refactoring pattern being applied

### Edit sequence:
1. [First specific change] - Purpose: [why]
2. [Second specific change] - Purpose: [why]
3. Do you approve this plan? I'll proceed with Edit [number] after your confirmation.
4. WAIT for explicit user confirmation before making ANY edits when user ok edit [number]

### EXECUTION PHASE
- After each individual edit, clearly indicate progress:
  "âœ… Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?"
- If you discover additional needed changes during editing:
- STOP and update the plan
- Get approval before continuing
